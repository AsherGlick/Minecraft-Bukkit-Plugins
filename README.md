Minecraft Plugins
=================
These are all plugins that I wrote for the use of playing on a bukkit minecraft server.  
While developing them I will continue to produce better documentation for them.  
They are ment to be used together and currently do not have much in the ways of  
error checking for environments that they do not expect to be in.  

Switching to Github
-------------------
I used this repo as a test of bitbucket, and the result is that for an open source program  
github just cannot be beat. I do hope it stays that way too!
